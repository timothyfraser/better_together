\item[a] Statistical Significance: *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05, . p < 0.10.
\item[b] LR Test: Likelihood Ratio tests show how much new model improved log-likelihood, versus previous model. Statistically significant increase in log-likelihood means better model. Tests show model 4 fits best.
\item[c] Effects: Beta coefficients indicate the projected increase in city's vulnerability index (1-10) given 1-unit increase in predictor on a scale from 1 (min) to 10 (max). All predictors rescaled from 1 to 10 for easy comparison of effect sizes. Treatment effects show projected increase in vulnerability given a 1-unit increase in predictor as time increases from by 1. Time measured from 1-18 (1 = 2000, 2 = 2001, etc.)
\item[d] Exp. refers to spending, normalized by population. Variance Inflation Factors all below 10, showing no collinearity problems.
