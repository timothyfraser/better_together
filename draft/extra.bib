Moreover, as recent social capital studies have examined the different types of associations that contribute to the formation of social capital in various ways, for this present study, associations were categorized as civic, reward-based, and social/recreational. The results indicate that both respondents’ experiences with disasters and their perceived risks of disasters tend to increase both the number of associations in which they participate and their degree of involvement. However, experiences related to disasters had a higher impact on the number of associations in which residents participate than on their degree of involvement. Individuals’ experiences with disasters also increased their tendency to join civic associations, whereas their perceived risks of disasters increased participation in both civic and reward-based associations. Social/recreational associations were not significantly affected by either disaster experiences or the perceived risks of a disaster.},

  abstract={•Increased evacuation-related mobility did not lead to increased cases of COVID-19.•Sheltering-in-place during a disaster led to decreased COVID-19 transmission rates.•Shelter-in-place orders could prevent a disaster within a disaster in a pandemic.•Updated accommodation and cleaning protocols could curb the spread of disease.
    Since the start of the pandemic, some U.S. communities have faced record storms, fires, and floods. Communities have confronted the increased challenge of curbing the spread of COVID-19 amid evacuation orders and short-term displacement that result from hazards. This raises the question of whether disasters, evacuations, and displacements have resulted in above-average infection rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigates the relationship between disaster intensity, sheltering-in-place, evacuation-related mobility, and contagion following Hurricane Zeta in Southeastern Louisiana and The Wildfires in Napa and Sonoma Counties, California, known as the Glass Fire. We draw on data from the county subdivision level and mapped and aggregated tallies of Facebook user movement from the Facebook Data for Good program’s GeoInsights Portal. We test the effects of disasters, evacuation, and shelter-in-place behaviors on COVID-19 spread using panel data models, matched panel models, and synthetic control experiments. Our findings suggest associations between disaster intensity and higher rates of COVID-19 cases. We also find that while sheltering-in-place led to decreases in the spread of COVID-19, evacuation-related mobility did not result in our hypothesized surge of cases immediately after the disasters. The findings from this study aim to inform policymakers and scholars about how to better respond to disasters during multi-crisis events, such as offering hotel accommodations to evacuees instead of mass shelters and updating intake and accommodation procedures at shelters, such as administration temperature screenings, offering hand sanitizing stations, and providing isolated areas for ill evacuees.},

  abstract={Recent proposals to produce and import hydrogen from Australia to Japan for electricity generation raise questions about how to compare the costs and feasibilities of different hydrogen import pathways. This paper establishes a framework for the comparison of technological, economic, and social costs and feasibility. The framework is then applied to three potential production and import case studies. Firstly, a benchmark case study is considered which uses Australian brown coal from the Latrobe Valley combined with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology. The second and third comparative case studies use renewable energy and electrolysis near to port facilities in Karratha, Western Australia using solar power exclusively as the renewable energy source, and Gladstone, Queensland using a combination of onshore wind and solar based generation. The study finds that comparative pilot project generation costs for the brown coal pathway are between 3.2 and 11.9 yen per kWh cheaper than for solar and/or wind based pathways. However, limitations of scaling up CCS, a limited brown coal supply, long-term reducing costs of renewables, and the prospect to develop complementary renewable infrastructure make a strong counterargument for investment in solar and wind pathways as an alternative to brown coal and CCS.}

	abstract={The sustainability of energy policy performance is determined by a combination of environmental, economic and equity impacts on society. To date, analysis of the equity impacts of energy policy have been largely overlooked in favour of environmental and economic impacts. As equity is an important issue within sustainability and energy justice considerations, this paper sets out to provide a framework and methodology which allows an assessment of both policy effectiveness in terms of an environmental and economic evaluation, followed up by an assessment of resultant quantitative equity impacts on society, in order to engender a holistic policy sustainability evaluation. Following an investigation of prominent energy policy equity issues and Australian peoples preferences towards equity, multiple scenarios are evaluated for effectiveness within the Australian National Electricity Market. The results of this evaluation provide an evidence base for the development of an alternative energy scenario which addresses the identified equity issues whilst meeting policy goals. The equity evaluation demonstrates the comparative equity resultant from each scenario and identifies the apportioning of burden according to income level. The proposed evaluation processes allow the policy maker to develop policies sensitive to both effectiveness and equity, and can be applied in energy justice conscious jurisdictions.},

	abstract={Study objective Hospital evacuations have myriad effects on all elements of the health care system. We seek to (1) examine the effect of patient surge on hospitals that received patients from evacuating hospitals in New York City during Hurricane Sandy; (2) describe operational challenges those hospitals faced pre- and poststorm; and (3) examine the coordination efforts to distribute patients to receiving hospitals. Methods We used a qualitative, interview-based method to identify medical surge strategies used at hospitals receiving patients from evacuated health care facilities during and after Hurricane Sandy. We identified 4 hospital systems that received the majority of evacuated patients and those departments most involved in managing patient surge. We invited key staff at those hospitals to participate in on-site group interviews. Results We interviewed 71 key individuals. Although all hospitals had emergency preparedness plans in place before Hurricane Sandy, we identified gaps. Insights gleaned included improvement opportunities in these areas: prolonged increased patient volume, an increase in the number of methadone and dialysis patients, ability to absorb displaced staff, the challenges associated with nursing homes that have evacuated and shelters that have already reached capacity, and reimbursements for transferred patients. Conclusion Our qualitative, event-based research identified key opportunities to improve disaster preparedness. The specific opportunities and this structured postevent approach can serve to guide future disaster planning and analyses.},

	journal={Natural hazards (Dordrecht)},
	volume={93},
	number={3},
	pages={1629-1648},
	abstract={In September 2008, Hurricane Ike caused massive damages to Galveston Island’s residential structures including four public housing developments. These developments were located in neighborhoods with some of the lowest incomes and highest percentages of people of color on the Island. Four months later, the Galveston Housing Authority (GHA) decided to demolish all four developments consisting of 569 housing units due to the damages to the buildings. Today, despite federal regulations requiring reconstruction, court orders mandating replacement of the demolished units, and available funding, only 142 low-income apartments have been rebuilt. We used the social vulnerability framework to understand these outcomes through the ability of groups to shape post-disaster recovery decisions. This paper argues that one of the overlooked characteristics of social vulnerability is a diminished ability to participate in post-disaster decision-making. We found that social vulnerability limited participation through three distinct mechanisms: the physical displacement of public housing residents, the stigmatization of public housing, and the reduction of residents to housing units in the debates. There were few local advocates arguing for the preservation of public housing units and even fewer remaining residents to speak up for themselves in the face of strong local resistance to the reconstruction of public housing units or the return of public housing residents. The void of a strong and authentic local pro-public housing perspective in Galveston provided an opening for various local campaigns to claim that their desired plan benefited the poor. The disaster recovery became an opportunity to remove or reduce public housing units and therefore public housing residents. Our findings show the dynamic features of vulnerability. While static factors of vulnerability can limit access to resources for recovery, dynamic processes of social marginalization and exclusion limit the voices of socially vulnerable groups in recovery decisions and exacerbate marginalization.},

	abstract={AbstractWhile public participation can improve recovery planning, post-disaster environments pose unique challenges and opportunities that can enhance or undermine participation depending on the recovery policies and features of the planning process. This paper presents findings of archival research and in-depth interviews in a qualitative case study of Galveston (Texas) following Hurricane Ike to examine the challenges and successes of participatory recovery planning in Galveston and the factors that shape these outcomes. Seizing heightened participation momentum after a disaster by engaging residents in a transparent process provides optimism and an opportunity for recovery champions to gain support for their ideas. However, planning while unprepared, homogeneity of participants, and skipping deliberation may limit voices of the marginalized residents in decisions and undermine implementation of the proposals. Under-represented socially vulnerable groups should be included in all stages of recovery planning through deliberate outreach strategies tailored to their circumstances. Supported by professional planners and technical experts, involved stakeholders should engage in deliberation rather than mere input solicitation to increase the effectiveness of post-disaster participatory planning.},

	volume={36},

	pages={4020074},
	abstract={AbstractOn September 20, 2017, Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Maria. To continue on their path to recovery, many households have, when other resources became scarce, relied on informal housing reconstruction, such as building without a contractor and using untrained labor. Housing in Puerto Rico has a history of informality that goes back long before Hurricane Maria, and behind this behavior are many complex, interwoven drivers. As one way to understand why certain households—and not others—were able to use informal reconstruction in their recovery process, this study uses social capital theory, in the form of bonding, bridging, and linking social capital. This study answers the following question: “What forms of social capital are most salient in supporting informal housing reconstruction by households in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria?” Surveys were conducted with household owners in two municipalities of Puerto Rico. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that people’s bridging social capital was positively associated with their level of informal housing reconstruction, and negatively associated with their level of completed reconstruction among homeowners who reconstructed informally. These results have theoretical implications for social capital in disaster recovery, including the importance of promoting connections among heterogeneous groups. The research contributes to policy and practice by specifying the key social relationships that allow households to continue rebuilding when official processes, such as using a contractor or obtaining permits, become inaccessible or ineffective.},

This study investigates the relationship between state and local policies and Covid‐19 deaths, combining three datasets: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index; local laws and regulations from the COVID Analysis and Mapping of Policies (AMP) database; and Covid‐19 deaths by county reported by The New York Times. It examines, using propensity score matching, local policies and regulations as treatments during the crisis, and assesses how, inter alia, face mask requirements, gathering restrictions, stay‐at‐home orders, and social distancing mandates enacted at the county level altered Covid‐19 deaths. The results indicate that the first three variables reduced average Covid‐19 deaths in high‐vulnerability communities. Despite clear gaps in federal policy guidance and coordinated policies, some efforts led by local and state governments promoted safer behaviour and lessened the impact of Covid‐19 in communities, especially those with higher social vulnerability rates.},

  abstract={Hurricane Harvey was social media's first real stress test. Despite headlines that praise platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Nextdoor for their role in disasters, we still know little about how community resilience differs across these platforms in a single event across a single measure of recovery. With an original dataset from a survey administered in Houston 39 days following Hurricane Harvey, this study explores the community resilience outcomes across users of Facebook, Twitter, and Nextdoor; more specifically, if users agreed that their neighbors engaged in neighborhood-level coordinated recovery efforts in the weeks following the storm. Controlling for collective efficacy, storm impact, amount of aid received, age, gender, income, education attainment, home tenure, and survey modality, findings from two multinomial logistic regression analyses reveal that individuals who used Nextdoor were more likely to receive help from neighbors to collect and pile debris following Hurricane Harvey compared to individuals who indicated they never used the platform, a finding not found among Facebook and Twitter users. This study identifies important differences in the resilience outcomes across these three platforms and discusses implications for future research and resilience policies.},

The study distinguished three types of associations-civic, reward-based, and social/recreational-and three types of damage from natural hazards-property loss, psychological trauma, and injury-to determine whether they have different effects on the adoption of hazard preparedness behaviours. The results of this study indicate that the members of voluntary associations were more prepared for natural hazards than non-members; the members of civic and reward-based associations tended to take significantly more preparedness measures than non-members, whereas the members of social/recreational associations did not. In particular, the members of reward-based associations were likely to initiate their first preparation measures. Meanwhile, both damage experience and risk perception showed positive effects on the adoption of preparedness behaviours, but these effects were stronger for typhoons than for earthquakes.},

This mixed-methods study examines the case of 30 advisory committees across 25 municipalities in Miyagi and Iwate Prefectures in northeast Japan after the 3/11 triple disasters. Drawing on synthetic control experiments, social network analysis, and case studies, we test whether the design of these committees’ policies or the traits of these committee networks improved the recovery trajectories of municipalities. We find that communities highly connected to this network of advisory committees saw better economic recovery than expected, especially when researchers, hyper-connected individuals, or plans for community centers were involved, controlling for disaster damage, infrastructure quality, social vulnerability, governance capacity, emergency services, and social capital. Our results bring with them a number of concrete policy recommendations for disaster managers, local residents, and decision makers.},

	journal={Natural hazards review},
	volume={22},
	number={3},
	abstract={AbstractA growing body of disaster scholarship uses qualitative and quantitative methods to illuminate the role of social capital and social networks in recovery and resilience outcomes. However, this approach seems disconnected from older approaches based on broader themes such as vulnerability. Which school of thought is more prominent in disaster social science, and to what degree are these fields interconnected? To address this question, this study used network analysis to visualize citation patterns, schools of thought, and influential authors from 912 articles on disasters. This analysis finds that while all clusters of disaster research deal with some kind of vulnerability—such as age, poverty, race, and gender—only one of six main research clusters engages scholarship on social capital. Despite this gap, the most influential works in the field point to strong synergies between social capital and vulnerability research. This work highlights the role of social capital in helping to understand how vulnerable populations can organize to mitigate disaster outcomes, and using the insights of vulnerability scholars on race and gender to improve social capital scholars’ understanding of bridging and bonding social ties in disaster recovery.},

	journal={Natural hazards review},
	volume={14},
	number={3},
	pages={151-162},
	abstract={AbstractEvacuations have long been studied within disciplinary boundaries, most frequently in the social sciences and in transportation engineering. Despite the common object of study, previous works integrating these fields’ perspectives are relatively sparse, sometimes leading to evacuation planning models that are divorced from social theory or that observed human behavior. However, a multidisciplinary solution is difficult because many social findings are not directly transferable to optimization formulations or simulation models. Most studies fail to recognize that human behavior and transportation systems are intertwined and that decisions depend not only on the disaster but also on the transportation conditions, options, sociodemographics, experiences, and risk perceptions. This paper reviews these two approaches to evacuation research and proposes a new interdisciplinary approach that merges the strengths of each. The process not only seeks to incorporate empirical and theoretical insights from the social sciences into transportation evacuation modeling but also calls for reexamination of some transportation modeling assumptions in order to improve their mapping in the real world. The result is a new five step modeling process.},

  abstract={Effectively controlling the spread of contagious illnesses has become a critical focus of disaster planning. It is likely that quarantine will be a key part of the overall public health strategy utilised during a pandemic, an act of bioterrorism or other emergencies involving contagious agents. While the United States lacks recent experience of large‐scale quarantines, it has considerable accumulated experience of large‐scale evacuations. Risk perception, life circumstance, work‐related issues, and the opinions of influential family, friends and credible public spokespersons all play a role in determining compliance with an evacuation order. Although the comparison is not reported elsewhere to our knowledge, this review of the principal factors affecting compliance with evacuations demonstrates many similarities with those likely to occur during a quarantine. Accurate identification and understanding of barriers to compliance allows for improved planning to protect the public more effectively.},

	journal={Population and environment},
	volume={31},

	pages={179-202},
	abstract={The historical disparities in the socio-demographic structure of New Orleans shaped the social vulnerability of local residents and their responses to Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. These disparities, derived from race, class, gender, and age differences, have resulted in the uneven impact of the catastrophe on various communities in New Orleans, and importantly, their ability to recover. This article examines how the pre-existing social vulnerabilities within New Orleans interacted with the level of flood exposure to produce inequities in the socio-spatial patterns of recovery. Utilizing a combination of statistical and spatial approaches, we found a distinct geographic pattern to the recovery suggesting that the social burdens and impacts from Hurricane Katrina are uneven—the less flooded and less vulnerable areas are recovering faster than tracts with more vulnerable populations and higher levels of flooding. However, there is a more nuanced story, which suggests that it is neighborhoods in the mid-range of social vulnerability where recovery is lagging. While private resources and government programs help groups in the high and low categories of social vulnerability, the middle group shows the slowest rates of recovery. Further, it appears that the congressionally funded State of Louisiana Road Home Program (designed to provide compensation to Louisiana's homeowners who suffered impacts by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita for the damage to their home) is not having a significant effect in stimulating recovery within the city.},

    This paper studies distributional effects of public transport (PT) subsidies focusing on the Greater Oslo region. We identify how different PT markets enjoy different levels of subsidies. We describe how subsidies are distributed along PT modes and their respective patronage. This is done by document studies and travel surveys, supplemented by expert inquiries.
    Results
    We find that high-income groups, served by regional trains and high-speed crafts, receive large per passenger and per passenger-kilometre subsidy, while lower-income areas, typically served by local and regional buses, metros and local trains, receive lower subsidies per passenger. Peak traffic receives higher subsidies than off-peak traffic. The overall distributional profile is, however, found to be moderately progressive, in particular because of the socio-economic profile of the average PT passenger relative to the population as a whole.},

I argue that redistributive policy in favor of cities, while temporarily reducing urban grievances, in the long-run undermines regime survival by inducing urban concentration. I test the argument using cross-national city population, urban bias, and nondemocratic regime survival data in the post-WWII period. The results show that urban concentration is dangerous for dictators principally by promoting collective action, that urban bias induces urban concentration, and that urban bias represents a Faustian bargain with short-term benefits overwhelmed by long-term costs.},

  journal={Social Science and Medicine},
  abstract={The human consequences of the 3.11 tsunami were not distributed equally across the municipalities of the Tohoku region of northeastern Japan. Instead, the mortality rate from the massive waves varied tremendously from zero to ten percent of the local residential population. What accounts for this variation remains a critical question for researchers and policy makers alike. This paper uses a new, sui generis data set including all villages, towns, and cities on the Pacific Ocean side of the Tohoku region to untangle the factors connected to mortality during the disaster. With data on demographic, geophysical, infrastructure, social capital, and political conditions for 133 municipalities, we find that tsunami height, stocks of social capital, and level of political support for the long-ruling LDP strongly influenced mortality rates. Given the high probability of future large scale catastrophes, these findings have important policy implications for disaster mitigation policies in Japan and abroad.},
